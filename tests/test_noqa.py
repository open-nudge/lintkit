"""Test `noqa`/`ignore` strings functionality.

Note:
    Each `function` is named `miss*` as this is the regex
    defined in `conftest` which __should match__
    `TestNoqa` rule in `conftest.py` IF there was no
    `noqa` strings.

Warning:
    Please note there should be __no matches__ in
    this module due to provided `noqa`/`ignore` strings.
