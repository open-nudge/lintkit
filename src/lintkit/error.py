"""`lintkit` custom errors.

These errors __should not be caught__, but
rather used to inform:

- `linter` developers about common mistakes they
made during rules creation (__most common__)
- `linter` users about common mistakes they made
(e.g. incorrect `noqa` ignores usage)

For the first example we might have:

```python
import ast
import lintkit


class MyRule(
    lintkit.check.Regex,
    lintkit.loader.Python,
    lintkit.rule.Node,
    code="123",  # offending line (should be an integer)
):
    def regex(self):
        return ".*"  # match everything

    def values(self):
        nodes = self.getitem("nodes_map")[ast.ClassDef]
        for node in nodes:
            yield lintkit.Value.from_python(node.name, node)
```

which raises:

```python
lintkit.error.CodeNotIntegerError:
    Rule 'MyRule' has code '123' which is of type 'str',
    but should be a positive `integer` .
```

while the second example might be (file being linted):

```python
def bar():
    pass


# noqa-start: MYRULE10
def foo():
    pass


# No noqa-end specified
```

which raises:

```python
lintkit.error.IgnoreRangeError:
    End of ignore range missing, please specify it.
    Start of the range was at line `4` with content: `# noqa-start: MYRULE10`.
```
