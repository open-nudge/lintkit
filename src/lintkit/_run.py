    """Run all the rules on a given file.

    Caution:
        This function has two modes; one returns `bool`
        indicating whether __any rule raised any error__
        (the default), the second one returns
        __all rules and their error codes__ via an `iterator`.

    Tip:
        Use `output=False` if you create a custom linter
        and __only want to return the appropriate exit code__
        (most common usage)

    An example of minimal linter:

    Example:
        ```python
        import sys

        import lintkit

        # Mini linter over two files
        # Assuming appropriate rules were already defined


        def linter(*files: str):
            sys.exit(lintkit.run(*files))


        linter("a.py", "~/user/goo.py")
        ```

    An example of iteration:

    Example:
        ```python
        import lintkit

        for failed, rule in lintkit.run("file.yml", "another.yml", output=True):
            print(f"Rule {rule} returned with an exit code {failed}")
        ```

    Tip:
        `output=True` (iteration mode) allows to gather general
        statistics from each rule and adjust the output to your
        liking.

    Warning:
        `exclude_codes` takes precedence over `include_codes`!

    Args:
        files:
            Files to lint.
        include_codes:
            A set of rule codes to include. If `None`, all rules are included.
        exclude_codes:
            A set of rule codes to ignore. If `None`, no rules are ignored.
            Warning: `exclude_codes` takes precedence over `include_codes`.
        end_mode:
            Whether to stop after the first error or run all rules.
            By default runs all rules.
        output:
            If `True`, returns an iterator over all rules and their outputs.
            If `False`, returns whether any rule raised an error.

    Returns:
        An iterator over all rules and their outputs OR a boolean indicating
            whether any rule raised an error.
